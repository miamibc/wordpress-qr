Plugin adds [qr] shortcode and shows QR image in admin pages of all post types.

== Description ==

You can put shortcode `[qr]` in your post to display QR code with address of your page, or any other page by including `[qr link="http://example.com"]`. In admin pages of post/page/custom post type, you'll see QR code when it is published.
